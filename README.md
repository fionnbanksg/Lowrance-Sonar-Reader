Lowrance Sonar Reader

This simple application allows the reading of Lowrance .SL3 or .SL2 sonar files. It allows the data to be viewed or exported as a .CSV or .TXT file for further use.

It is based around the methods used by Kenneth ThorÃ¸ Martinsen in his post on detainwater:

Please note the application may contain bugs, and is simply for educational purposes.

Using the file application:
  -  files gui.py and reader.py into a IDE that supports Python3
  -  run gui.py and wait for the window to appear
  -  click file>open SL file
  -  The file will load in and allow visualisation and further manipulation
